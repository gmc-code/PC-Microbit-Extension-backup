Games using classes
--------------------

| The games in this section are built via the use of classes.
| The games use a class for the game object since it makes it easy to group together the game data and the game functions.
| The game data are attributes. Attributes are variables belonging to a class.
| The game functions are methods. Methods are functions associated with a class.
