Objects
----------------------

| In Python, strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, dictionaries etc. are objects with their own data and methods.
| Every object has:
* a type
* data
* methods

| e.g.  the string object 'hello'
* type is str
* data is 'hello'
* methods are the standard string methods such a ``.title()`` and ``.lower()``.

Classes and Objects
----------------------

| A Class is a code template, an object constructor, a blueprint for creating instances (objects).
| An instance of a class is an object which has a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data.

| Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. 
| Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. 
| Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. 
| Class instances can also have methods for modifying its state.
