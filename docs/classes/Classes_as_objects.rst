Objects
----------------------

| In Python, strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, dictionaries etc. are objects, with their own data and methods.
| Every object has:
* a type
* data
* methods

| e.g.  the string object 'hello'
* type is str
* data is 'hello'
* methods are the standard string methods such a ``.title()`` and ``.lower()``.

Classes and Objects
----------------------

| A Class is a code template, an object constructor, a blueprint for creating instances (objects).

| The name of the class is in camel case. e.g. **LevelGame**. Each word is capitalized and there are no underscores.
