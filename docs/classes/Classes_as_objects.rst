Classes and Objects
----------------------

| A Class is a code template or blueprint for creating instances (objects).
| An instance of a class is an object which has a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data.

| Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. 
| Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. 
| Each class instance can also have methods for modifying its state.
